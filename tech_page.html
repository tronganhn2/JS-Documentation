            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
            is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
            example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
            its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
            and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
            structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
            variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
            example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
              to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
              client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
              HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
              and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
              relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
              extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
              provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
              the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
            language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
            most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why
            it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in multi-line mode, and write your first "Hello
          world" JavaScript code:
          <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } greetMe("World");
                  </code>

          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser! <br>
          In the following pages, this guide introduces you to the JavaScript syntax and language features, so that you
          will be able to write more complex applications.

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
          identifiers, conform to certain rules. <br>

          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters
          can also be digits (0–9). <br>

          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as
          "a" through "z" (lowercase).

      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <article>
          You can declare a variable in three ways:
          <p>
            With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
            can be used to declare both local and global variables, depending on the execution context.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the keyword const or let. For example, <code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax can be used to declare a
            block-scope local variable. (See Variable scope below.)
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also simply assign a value to a variable For example,<code>x = 42.</code> This form creates an
            undeclared global variable. It also generates a strict JavaScript warning. Undeclared global variables can
            often lead to unexpected behavior. Thus, it is discouraged to use undeclared global variables.
          </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Evaluating_variables">
        <header>Evaluating variables </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            A variable declared using the var or let statement with no assigned value specified has the value of
            undefined.
          </p>
          You can use undefined to determine whether a variable has a value. In the following code, the variable input
          is not assigned a value, and the if statement evaluates to true.
          <code>var input;
              if (input === undefined) {
                doThis();
              } else {
                doThat();
              }</code>
          <p>
            The undefined value behaves as false when used in a boolean context.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available
            to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a
            local variable, because it is available only within that function.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope. Rather, a variable declared within a
            block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within.
            <br>
            For example, the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the global context (or the function
            context if the code is part of a function). The scope of x is not limited to the immediate if statement
            block.
          </p>
          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
          <p>
            This behavior changes when using the let declaration (introduced in ECMAScript 2015).
          </p>

          <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                    defined</code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_hoisting">
        <header>Variable hoisting</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Another unusual thing about variables in JavaScript is that you can refer to a variable declared later,
            without getting an exception.
          </p>

          <p>
            This concept is known as hoisting. Variables in JavaScript are, in a sense, "hoisted" (or "lifted") to the
            top of the function or statement. However, variables that are hoisted return a value of undefined. So even
            if you declare and initialize after you use or refer to this variable, it still returns undefined.
          </p>

          <p>In ECMAScript 2015, let and const are hoisted but not initialized. Referencing the variable in the block
            before the variable declaration results in a ReferenceError, because the variable is in a "temporal dead
            zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is processed.
            <code>console.log(x); // ReferenceError
              let x = 3;</code>
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Function_hoisting">
        <header>Function hoisting</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In the case of functions, only function declarations are hoisted—but not the function expressions.

            <code>
            /* Function declaration */

foo(); // "bar"

function foo() {
  console.log('bar');
}


/* Function expression */

baz(); // TypeError: baz is not a function

var baz = function() {
  console.log('bar2');
};
          </code>
